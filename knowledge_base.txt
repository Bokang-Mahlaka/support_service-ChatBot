# Hollard Lesotho Employee Benefits And Partnerships

## What Employee Benefits covers

### Retirement Fund Solutions

#### Provident Fund

It is a retirement fund vehicle that receives contributions (usually monthly) from employers and employees towards provision for post-retirement income. At retirement, a member can access the entire benefit as cash.

Benefits are paid out on either resignation, retrenchment, death or retirement only.

#### Pension Fund

It is a retirement fund vehicle that receives contributions (usually monthly) from employers and employees towards provision for post-retirement income. At retirement, a member can access up to one-third of the benefit in cash, and the remaining two-thirds must be used to purchase an annuity (Monthly Pension).

Benefits are paid out on either resignation, retrenchment, death or retirement only.

### Group Risk Benefits

#### Death Benefit

Our basic Death Cover ensures that if an employee passes away, their family will be financially covered in future. The benefit is the same for every insured family member. It can be extended to cover funeral expenses or future education costs or to provide an extra payout due to an Accidental Death.

#### Funeral Benefit

Our Funeral Benefit gives employees the comfort of knowing that their families won't be left with the burden of paying for their funeral when they die. The benefit can either be taken out for a single individual, or as a family benefit that also covers the funeral costs of an employee's spouse, children, or parents.

#### Accidental Death Benefit

If an employee dies because of an accident, we'll pay out a lump sum that their loved ones can use as they wish. This is an additional payment on top of an existing life insurance payout. It is often taken out by employers whose employees may have higher risks of being in an accident due to the nature of their work.

#### Disability Income Benefit

Few things can be as worrying for an employee as being unable to earn an income – especially if they are the main breadwinner. Our Disability Income Benefit ensures that employees receive a monthly income should they become disabled and be unable to work, due to an accident or illness.

#### Lump Sum Disability Benefit

Our Lump Sum Disability Benefit ensures that employees receive a lump sum of money if they become totally and permanently disabled due to illness or injury and are unable to work. This money can be used to pay for upfront expenses relating to their disability, and the balance can then be reinvested to provide a monthly income for the years to come.

#### Critical Illness Benefit

Our Critical Illness cover pays for any lifestyle changes employees may need to make if diagnosed with a critical illness. We also offer this benefit on a standalone basis, so it doesn't have to be attached to an existing life insurance policy.

#### Medical Premium Waiver

Our Medical Premium Waiver Benefit gives peace of mind to the employees, knowing that even if they become disabled, their medical aid premiums will still be paid and their spouse and children will still be covered for medical aid benefits.

#### Educator

If an employee who is the insured parent passes away, our Educator Benefit provides their family with financial support to help cover the increasing costs of education. This ensures children can still have the future they deserve, even if their parents are no longer here to provide for them.

Family Funeral Cover is applicable for the lifetime of the MLI with premiums being paid until the MLI attains the age of 60 (sixty). The Family Funeral Cover provides a lump sum payment to help meet the final expenses when the MLI or a nominated family member dies. The cover selected and the family members insured are shown on the Proposal and Policy Schedule. In the event of the accidental death of the MLI or a nominated family member, the funeral benefit payable will be double the cover stated on the Proposal and Policy Schedule.

This cover is for life, as long as premiums are paid until the MLI reaches 60 (sixty) years of age. Children’s cover under this benefit ceases at age 21 (twenty first birthday). You have the option once your child reaches age 21 (twenty one) to nominate him under the Extended Family funeral cover. You can exercise this option by sending written communication to Lesotho National Life 30 (thirty) days prior to or after the child’s 21st (twenty first) birthday. Stillborn children of the MLI qualify for cover for the total amount of M1,250 (one thousand two hundred and fifty Maluti) payable once during the lifetime of the policy subject to the pregnancy having endured for a minimum period of 26 (twenty six) weeks and older.

### Waiting Periods

The waiting period for this benefit is 6 (six) months from the Date of Acceptance of the policy, provided that the first premium has been deducted and paid to Lesotho National Life in the month in which the deduction was scheduled (in the Proposal and Policy Schedule). Where the initial Date of Commencement has been changed due to an unsuccessful deduction of the first premium, the waiting period will be calculated from the Date of Commencement.

Any additional members added to the policy or voluntary increases in benefits after the Date of Acceptance will have a 12 month waiting period for death due to natural causes.

In the event of the death of any life insured on this policy due to natural causes during the waiting period, the Risk Premiums paid during the waiting period for the Funeral Benefit are refunded. Only the Risk Premiums in respect of that life insured are refunded.

### Specific Provisions and Conditions:

General Exclusions – when we will not pay any benefits

Certain benefit sections might have specific exclusions that apply in addition to these general exclusions. You must read this section together with each benefit section.

In addition to any specific exclusions set out in each benefit section, we will not pay a claim for an _insured event_ because of any of the exclusions listed below:

1.  Criminal activities
    
    We will not pay a claim if any _insured event_ is directly or indirectly caused by criminal activities. Criminal activity means the _insured person_ is or was:
    
    *   under investigation for committing a crime;
    *   being prosecuted for committing a crime; or
    *   convicted by a Court of Law for having committed a crime.
    
    We will delay our claims decision until the finalisation of the investigation, or the criminal trial (as applicable). The _claimant_ must give us proof of the outcome of the investigation or the criminal trial (as applicable).
    
2.  The insured person was not eligible
    
    We will not pay a claim for an _insured person_ if he was not eligible or did not meet the definition of _insured person_ on his _benefit start date_.
    
    If we do not pay the claim because the _insured person_ was not eligible, we will refund all the _total premiums_ we have received since his _benefit start date_.
    
    If we do not pay the claim because the _insured person_ was untruthful, we will not refund any _total premiums_ we have received since his _benefit start date_.
    
3.  Insured event or accident before the benefit start date

3.  Information and documents we need
    
    We need certain information and documents to assess a claim. The _claimant_ must give us all the information and documents we ask for. If the _claimant_ does not give us the information and documents we need, we may delay or reject the claim.

Your policy
This policy is a legal contract between you and us and includes your application, the policy wording and the policy schedule.

The application is where you asked us to cover all the insured persons under this policy, and where you gave us permission to collect the monthly total premium.
The application could be the electronic or physical form that you completed when you applied for this policy; or
If this policy was sold to you telephonically, the recording of the conversation we had with you, the main insured person and any other insured person will be part of this policy. The conversation includes all the information given to us.
If you make any changes or additions to the policy after the policy start date, the electronic or physical form you completed, or the recording of the telephonic conversation we had with you when you made the changes will also be part of this policy.
The policy schedule is issued with your policy wording and sets out (amongst other things) the details of the policyholder and the insured persons. It also sets out which benefits you chose, benefit amounts, the benefit premium, policy fee, total premium and all other information that is not set out in the policy documents.
The policy wording includes the general terms and conditions and the benefit sections as explained below:

The general terms and conditions (this document) includes all the terms, conditions and exclusions that apply to all the benefit sections. You must read the general terms and conditions together with each benefit section and your policy schedule.
The benefit sections set out the terms and conditions specific to the selected benefit.
The policy schedule and policy wording make up your policy document that we sent to you. You must carefully read these documents together. Make sure you understand what you are covered for as well as what your responsibilities are. If you do not keep to the terms of this policy, it may result in us not paying a claim or cancelling your policy.

If you find any errors on the policy schedule, please tell us immediately on the contact details set out in the Additional information document.

We are not bound by any changes unless we have agreed to them in writing and have included them into this policy by issuing you with a new policy wording or a new policy schedule. This policy document replaces all previous policy documents.
